# My Personal Project

## Attendance tracker

As a swim coach, I'm tasked with recording
the attendance of each practice/event that my
swimmers are expected to attend. However, the
software used to record attendance at my swim 
club is *impractical*. As a result, I wish to 
create an attendance tracker that stores
names/dates of practices (or other events),
along with the names of swimmers who attended
the particular practice/events.

Although this project was inspired by my job
as a swim coach, it could be used by any
person or organization who wishes to record
attendance for meetings, events, practice,
**and more**.

This project is especially interesting to me,
because I feel there could be many interesting
add-ons to the program. For example,
it would be helpful if the program could
keep track of each individual swimmer's
attendance and return their overall attendance
rate over the season.
